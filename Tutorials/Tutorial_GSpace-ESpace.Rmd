# Creating plots with the geographical and environmental space of a species in ggplot2

The function `GEspace` is a tool that can plot the geographical and environmental space of a species' presence in `ggplot2`. The output is a plot with a geographical map with occurrence points and a graph of the occurrence in relation to the environmental data, such as annual mean temperature or total annual precipitation, next to it.
\

### Parameters

For this function, two parameters are necessary and a two more can be added:

* `E.occ` = a matrix with occurrence and corresponding environmental data of a species
\

* `bckgrnd` = a matrix with random points from a specific geographic region and corresponding environmental data
\
  
* `add.poly` = a polygon of the study area (optional)
\
  
* `save.p` = saves the file to your set output folder (optional)
\
\

### Dependencies

* `rgdal`
\

* `raster`
\

* `ggplot2`
\

* `rnaturalearth`
\

* `rnaturalearthdata`
\

* `ggpubr`
\

* `sf`
\

* `rgeos`
\

\

## Function's code

### How *GEspace* works
  
Depending on the data input, the function `GEspace` will create a plot with a polygon or random background points as a geographical space.  
The default option (no polygon added, no graph saved) will create a map of the study area based on the coordinates of random background points and the occurrence points of a species. As a first step, the function will create a new matrix that combines the coordinates of the random background points and the occurrence points into two columns and adds a third column with a type (1 for background points and 2 for occurrence points). The background points and occurrence points are plotted as a geographical map to the left side. To the right side, the environmental space will be plotted. For this plot a data-frame is created (in the same manner as the previous data-frame) for the environmental data of the background and occurrence points. Those points are plotted in a Cartesian coordinate system. 
If the background points exceed 1000 objects, the point size in the graphs is reduced.  
  
If the user adds a polygon with `add.poly`, it will be used alongside a worldmap from the `rnaturalearth` packages for the mapping of the geographical space. The polygon is first transformed to the WGS 84 coordinate system. It serves as a mask on which the worldmap is clipped. Both, the polygon and clipped worldmap are used as a background map onto which the occurrence points of the species are plotted. The environmental space is plotted as above. 
  
If `save.p` is added to the function, then the graph will be saved, if not, a window with the graph will pop up.

### Output

The output is a plot with two graphs. On the left side is the geographical space and on the right side is the environmental space (with two environmental conditions) of a species' occurrence.
The output varies depending on how the function is applied. If a polygon is added, the background for the geographical space will be a clipped worldmap from the `rnaturalearth` packages overlayed with the polygon of the study area. If no polygon is added, the background will consist of random points of the study areay

### Open libraries

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(rgdal)
library(raster)
library(ggplot2)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(ggpubr)
# package "sf" needs to be installed, but not loaded
# package "rgeos" needs to be installed, but not loaded
```
\

### Input data
Two files are necessary to plot the graphs: a matrix with random geographical and environmental data of the study area that provides background points and a matrix that contains the coordinates of a species' occurrence and various environmental variables. Both can be created by using the `get.Ecoord` function (see tutorial "Function *get.Ecoord*").

It is important to note that both parameters, the matrices for `E.occ` and `bckgrnd`, need to have the same structure: the first two columns contain the coordinates, with longitude in the first column and latitude in the second. The following columns need to contain the environmental data of interest.
\
\

###  *Catasticta nimbice*
\

Distribution of the species *Catasticta nimbice* and its environmental space. In this example the number of background points is above 1000 and the point size is reduced in order to keep a clear display of points.

For the species' occurrence points in correspondence with environmental data the "occ_GE.csv"-file that was created with `get.Ecoord` is used.
```{r}
# read table of a species occurrence with environmental data points
species <- read.csv("./Generated_Data/Catasticta_nimbice_occ_GE.csv",header=T)


```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(species, n=5)
```

\

For the random background points in correspondence with environmental data the "M_GE.csv"-file that was created with `get.Ecoord` is used.  
```{r}
# read table with random background points
ranpoints <- read.csv("./Initial_Data/Catasticta_nimbice_M_GE.csv",header=T)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(ranpoints, n=5)
```

\

If a polygon of the distribution area is available, it can be added as a parameter.
```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE}
# read polygon
shp <- readOGR("./Initial_Data/shapefiles","nimbice3")

```
\

If the graph is to be saved, the location and name can be set.
```{r}
saveM <- "./Generated_Data/Catasticta_nimbice"

```
\

**Apply `GEspace`** (but do not run every time):  

No polygon added (default), no save.p added (default): A graph will pop up & the geographical background will be made of random points.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd=ranpoints, E.occ=species)
```
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Figure of the geographical space with random points as a background (left) and the environmental space (right) of *Catasticta nimbice* .", out.width = '70%',fig.align="center"}
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Catasticta_nimbice_points.png")
```
\


No polygon added (default), save.p added: The graph will be saved & the geographical background will be made of random points.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd=ranpoints, E.occ=species, save.p =  paste0(saveM, "_bckgrndmap.png"))
```


With polygon, no save.p added (default): A graph will pop up & the geographical background will be made of a polygon.
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd=ranpoints, E.occ=species, add.poly=shp)
```

With polygon, save.p added: A graph will pop up & the geographical background will be made of a polygon.
```{r, eval=FALSE, message= FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd=ranpoints, E.occ=species, add.poly=shp, save.p =  paste0(saveM, "_polymap.png"))
```
\

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Figure of the geographical space with a polygon and clipped worldmap as a background (left) and the environmental space (right) of *Catasticta nimbice* .", out.width = '70%',fig.align="center"}
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Catasticta_nimbice_poly.png")
```
\


### *Threnetes ruckeri*
\

Distribution of the species *Threnetes ruckeri* and its environmental space. In this example the number of background points is below 1000 and the point size is not reduced.

```{r, message=FALSE, results=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
ranpoints2 <- read.csv("./Generated_Data/Threnetes_ruckeri_M_GE.csv",header=T)
species2 <- read.csv("./Generated_Data/Threnetes_ruckeri_occ_GE.csv",header=T)
shp2 <- readOGR("./Initial_Data/shapefiles","Threnetes_ruckeri")

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd = ranpoints2, E.occ = species2, add.poly = shp2, save.p = "Threnetes_bckgrndmap.png")
GEspace(bckgrnd = ranpoints2, E.occ = species2, add.poly = shp2)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Figure of the geographical space with random points as a background (left) and the environmental space (right) of *Threnetes ruckeri* .", out.width = '70%',fig.align="center"}
options(knitr.duplicate.label = "allow")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Threnetes_ruckeri_points.png")
```
\

```{r, eval=FALSE}
GEspace(bckgrnd = ranpoints2, E.occ = species2, save.p = "Threnetes_polymap.png")
GEspace(bckgrnd = ranpoints2, E.occ = species2)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=" Figure of the geographical space with a polygon and clipped worldmap as a background (left) and the environmental space (right) of *Threnetes ruckeri* .", out.width = '70%',fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Threnetes_ruckeri_poly.png")
```
