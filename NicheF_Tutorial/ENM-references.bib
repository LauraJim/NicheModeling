abstract = {Abstract Correlative techniques for estimating environmental requirements of species – variably termed ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling – are becoming very popular tools for ecologists and biogeographers in understanding diverse aspects of biodiversity. These tools, however, are frequently applied in ways that do not fit well into knowledge frameworks in population ecology and biogeography, or into the realities of sampling biodiversity over real-world landscapes. We offer 10 “fixes” – adjustments to typical methodologies that will take into account population ecological and biogeographic frameworks to produce better models.},

abstract = {The field of ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling has seen enormous activity and attention in recent years, in light of exciting biological inferences that can be drawn from correlational models of species' environmental requirements (i.e., ecological niches) and inferences of potential geographic distributions. Among the many methods used in the field, one or two are in practice assumed to be ‘best' and are used commonly, often without explicit testing. We explore herein implications of the “No Free Lunch” theorem, which suggests that no single optimization approach will prove to be best under all circumstances: we developed diverse virtual species with known niche and dispersal properties to test a suite of niche modeling algorithms designed to estimate potential areas of distribution. The result was that (1) indeed, no single ‘best' algorithm was found, and (2) different algorithms perform in very different manners depending on the particularities of the virtual species. The conclusion is that niche or distribution modeling studies should begin by testing a suite of algorithms for predictive ability under the particular circumstances of the study, and choose an algorithm for a particular challenge based on the results of those tests. Studies that do not take this step may use algorithms that are not optimal for that particular challenge. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

We do this by: a) postulating a simple shape for the physiologically defined niche (Hutchinson's fundamental niche), b) providing prior information for the estimation of the parameters that define the shape of the niche, and c) interpreting the results taking into account how the actual observables are conditioned on the existing environmental universe.

abstract = {The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving-operating characteristic (or certain modifications of it) is almost universally used to assess the performance of species distribution models (SDMs), despite the well-recognized problems encountered with this approach, mainly present when dealing with presence-only data. We present a probabilistic treatment of the presence-only problem and derive a method to assess the performance of SDMs based on the analysis of an area-presence plot and the SDM outputs represented in both geographic and environmental spaces. We show how our method is useful to solve the two main tasks for which the AUC is used: assessing the performance of an SDM and comparing the performance of different SDMs. Our results build on previous work and constitute a rigorous method for assessing the performance of SDMs in relation to a random classifier. We establish comparisons with two of the most popular approaches used to assess the performance of an SDM, the AUC and the Boyce index, and identified cases in which our method has advantages over these two approaches. We suggest that the performance of an algorithm that classifies presence-only data can be assessed by two factors: (a) the degree of non-randomness of the classification at every step in the accumulation curve of presences, and (b) the amount of uninformative niche space used for the classification. The method we developed can be applied to any SDM output by using the R functions available at: https://github.com/LauraJim/SDM-hyperTest.},

abstract = {8 In the last years, studies that question important conceptual and methodological aspects 9 in the field of ecological niche modeling (and species distribution modeling) have cast doubts 10 on the validity of the existing methodologies. Particularly, it has been broadly discussed 11 whether it is possible to estimate the fundamental niche of a species using presence data. 12 Although it has being identified that the main limitation is that presence data come from 13 the realized niche, which is a subset of the fundamental niche, most of the existing methods 14 lack the ability to overcome it, and then, they fit objects that are more similar to the realized 15 niche. To overcome this limitation, we propose to use the region that is accessible to the 16 species (based on its dispersal abilities) to determine a sampling distribution in environ-17 mental space that allow us to quantify the likelihood of observing a particular environmental 18 combination in a sample of presence points. We incorporate this sampling distribution into a 19 multivariate normal model (Mahalanobis model) by creating a weight function that modifies 20 the probabilities of observing an environmental combination in a sample of presences as a 21 way to account for the uneven availability of environmental conditions. We show that the 22 parameters of the modified, weighted-normal model can be approximated by a maximum 23 likelihood estimation approach, and used to draw ellipsoids (confidence regions) that rep-24 resent the shape of the fundamental niche of the species. We illustrate the application of 25 our model with two worked examples: (i) using presence points of an invasive species and 26 an accessible area that includes only its native range, to evaluate whether the fitted model 27 1.

abstract = {For more than 50 years ecological niches have been defined as combinations of multidimensional environmental conditions permitting a species to survive and reproduce. A fundamental niche (NF) is defined as the set of conditions within which a species can live in the absence of competitors, and a realized niche (NR) is a NF hypothetically reduced by competitive interactions (and some other limiting factors). This definition implies that NF is 'larger' than NR, something that has been nearly universally accepted by ecologists. However, there have been few attempts at empirical tests. Here, we present a novel quantitative test using one-dimensional estimates of NF for 105 species of reptiles and amphibians, and estimates of NR obtained from ∼1.4 x 104 field observations. To specify our test, we operationalize the original classification of niche types. Our results predominantly support the hypothesis that NF is larger' than NR and we highlight the theoretical and practical importance of quantifying niches.},

abstract = {10.1073/pnas.0901637106 Estimating actual and potential areas of distribution of species via ecological niche modeling has become a very active field of research, yet important conceptual issues in this field remain confused. We argue that conceptual clarity is enhanced by adopting restricted definitions of “niche” that enable operational definitions of basic concepts like fundamental, potential, and realized niches and potential and actual distributional areas. We apply these definitions to the question of niche conservatism, addressing what it is that is conserved and showing with a quantitative example how niche change can be measured. In this example, we display the extremely irregular structure of niche space, arguing that it is an important factor in understanding niche evolution. Many cases of apparently successful models of distributions ignore biotic factors: we suggest explanations to account for this paradox. Finally, relating the probability of observing a species to ecological factors, we address the issue of what objects are actually calculated by different niche modeling algorithms and stress the fact that methods that use only presence data calculate very different quantities than methods that use absence data. We conclude that the results of niche modeling exercises can be interpreted much better if the ecological and mathematical assumptions of the modeling process are made explicit.},
